# rpg-engine
This project is a "simple" rpg engine with a Construction Set (CS) for editing the data files.

The project currently loads most images from paths stored in the "sprites.xml" file. 
Item and Entity creation systems are working now, so all Items and entities are dynamically created at runtime.

# To Do
- Create generic status effects in the game engine, that can be customized in the CS.
- Create a global variables xml file, to remove many hard coded and repeated sections (Mainly in skeletons and limbs)
- Get the NPC editor working in CS
- Make all editors in the CS able to preview existing XML nodes (graphically how they show up in game)
- Make all editors able to EDIT thier associated XML nodes

Much, much more
